# OpenGL-TankMazeGame

An OpenGL project for COMPUTER VISION & GRAPHICS (EEE2041), University of Surrey Electronic Engineering with Computer Systems 2016-2017

"Your task is to develop a 3rd person maze action game using OpenGL. The goal of the game is to navigate a tank around a maze using the keyboard and mouse and eliminate all targets within a time limit while avoiding traps and falling off the edges. An outline of the functionality you are required to implement is given below. Marks will be awarded for providing additional functionality and for ease of user interaction."

If you are visiting this page becuase you are also doing the same assisgment, start early becuase this is probubly the best and the most enjoyable coursework you will ever do.

How I completed this project, I am a farly bad programming, and I have no idea with OpenGL is, I still have to search up how to make a switch case and how to read from file, this is how bad I am in programming. My deadline was Monday and I started on Saturday, thinking I need to pass, attendance is 20% already, I just need to model a tank and some crete and I will have passed. Unforunly, I only turn up to labs to sign the attendance sheet and left after 10 minutes, so I have absoluly no idea about OpenGL. So my 48 hours hackathon begins.

Saturday
2pm - arrived at Lab, go through all tutorial, which I end up playing a game called 'FTL' on my laptop for 3 hours, until 6pm
6pm - Coursemate 1 suggested that I copy the code from tutorial into my code that would be useful, and she went home
1am - I made a cube and a coin inside the box that's it, there's no one in the labs to help me, so I gave up and went home.

Sunday
11am - I need to make the tank to get at least 30%, so I model the tank with the same code as the cube, but I forgot to make a new mash
3pm - Coursemate 1 arrived to debug the mash problem for me, which is simply int mash 1 and mash 2 ...
4pm - Now I got a tank, a box and a coin, but all at the same point, I need to learn how to translate, coursemate 2 explained it to me, which lucky the function is already provided (Matrix.ccp).
5pm - I got a maze map and a tank, I passed!!! But I still have time, I will continue on. [SEE PICTURE 1]
6pm - I got the tank to move foward, back and sliding sideways. I've also got the camera to follow the tank. [SEE Video 1] 
10pm - The tank can now turn, but still can't collect coins or fall down the side of the box/crate [SEE Video 2]
12a - Worked out how to collect the coins (Array value changes when it is in the box), same method for falling, but the tank is scaled to ~0, so it disappare.
2am- Everything is working now apart from shooting
3a - Too tried now, went home and sleep

Monday
10am - Went to lecture with my laptop to continue my work with the help of coursemate 3, he helped me to set up xcode on my macbook pro to work with OpenGL,
