# OpenGL-TankMazeGame .................. Press RAW ^

An OpenGL project for COMPUTER VISION & GRAPHICS (EEE2041), University of Surrey Electronic Engineering with Computer Systems 2016-2017

If you are visiting this page becuase you are also doing the same assisgment, start early becuase this is probubly the best and the most enjoyable coursework you will ever do.

"Your task is to develop a 3rd person maze action game using OpenGL. The goal of the game is to navigate a tank around a maze using the keyboard and mouse and eliminate all targets within a time limit while avoiding traps and falling off the edges. An outline of the functionality you are required to implement is given below. Marks will be awarded for providing additional functionality and for ease of user interaction."

How I completed this project, I am a farly bad programming, and I have no idea with OpenGL is, I still have to search up how to make a switch case and how to read from file, this is how bad I am in programming. My deadline was Monday and I started on Saturday, thinking I need to pass, attendance is 20% already, I just need to model a tank and some crete and I will have passed. Unforunly, I only turn up to labs to sign the attendance sheet and left after 10 minutes, so I have absoluly no idea about OpenGL. So my 48 hours hackathon begins.

Saturday

2pm - arrived at Lab, go through all tutorial, which I end up playing a game called 'FTL' on my laptop for 3 hours, until 6pm.

6pm - Coursemate 1 suggested that I copy the code from tutorial into my code that would be useful, and she went home.

1am - I made a cube and a coin inside the box that's it, there's no one in the labs to help me, so I gave up and went home.


Sunday

11am - I need to make the tank to get at least 30%, so I model the tank with the same code as the cube, but I forgot to make a new mash

3pm - Coursemate 1 arrived to debug the mash problem for me, which is simply int mash 1 and mash 2 ...

4pm - Now I got a tank, a box and a coin, but all at the same point, I need to learn how to translate, coursemate 2 explained it to me, which lucky the function is already provided (Matrix.ccp).

5pm - I got a maze map and a tank, I passed!!! But I still have time, I will continue on. [SEE PICTURE 1]

6pm - I got the tank to move foward, back and sliding sideways. I've also got the camera to follow the tank. [SEE Video 1]

10pm - The tank can now turn, but still can't collect coins or fall down the side of the box/crate [SEE Video 2]

12am - Worked out how to collect the coins (Array value changes when it is in the box), same method for falling, but the tank is scaled to ~0, so it disappare.

12am - coursemate 3 missed the last bus back to manor park, so he explained the head up display, it turns out to be very easy, becuase you just need to copy it from one of the tutorial. (I should have been the tutorial and not play games)

2am- Everything is working now apart from shooting.

3am - Too tried now, went home and sleep.


Monday

10am - Went to lecture with my laptop to continue my work with the help of coursemate 3, he helped me to set up xcode on my macbook pro to work with OpenGL, I continue to do minor changes. Coursemate 4 copied some of my idea into his, but he did gave me some support throughout the weekend over what's app, except he reply 'I will check for you later' everytime.

12pm - Went back to labs with coursemate 5, compared my game against hers, her game got physics and shooting.

1pm - Cycle to Mcdonlds to use my Monoply vochure as it was the deadline for it, got a chicken nuggets meal with orange juice and a coke for free, sat there for 15 minutes to eat my meal and I came up with the idea of a help meun.

2pm - Back to labs to make the meun, and trying to make shooting work.

4pm - Demonstrator and supervisor arrives, demonstrator helped me with shooting, turns out I just have an reseting loop, so it ball doesn't shoot, change that quickly, probuble still have 20 minutes until it is my turn for marking.

5pm - Is now my turn, 'make' the programe and I got a systematic error, he went on to the next guy when I try to sort it, I 'make clear' and 'qmake' and 'make', is working, I am so happy. Final mark is 87%.


Is has been a very hard journey and compared to a hackathon, there's no free food, no drinks... I didnt have time for implmenting physics, but it has been the best two days of my life, I learned OpenGL and C++ in two days. I am so comfident by Monday, I had been helping other to there problems. And lastly thank you to coursemate 1-5, without their help, I would not have got to this point.3738This was writen 1 month after the hand in day, all the timing are reconstructed from memory and what's app records. If you need any help, pop me a message on facebook, I am Teddy Ng and this is an introduction to OpenGL.
